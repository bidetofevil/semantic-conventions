    name: app.crash
    brief: >
      This event represents a termination of a user-facing application due to an unrecoverable error that is not expected by the user.
    note: |
      This event identifies an app crash, defined as a termination of a user-facing
      application due to an unrecoverable error that is not expected by the user. The
      source that identified and provided details about the crash can be the
      instrumentation itself, detecting and recording it synchronously at runtime just
      prior the termination of the app. Alternatively, sources external to the app
      could provide the instrumentation details about the crash some time after the
      app has terminated, allowing it to record the even asynchronously, perhaps
      hours and days after it occurred.
      It SHOULD contain information about the source that provided the crash data.
      While it MAY contain details about the crash in a single payload that can be
      used for contextualizing and grouping them, it is NOT REQUIRED that the
      semantics and schema of that payload can be used without additional data
      that is not present in this event (e.g. mapping files to deobfuscate
      stacktraces), as that is not always feasible. However, if a crash details
      payload is included, the format in which it was encoded MUST be provided.
      How the instrumentation will determine whether an instance of a crash has
      already been reported and how the necessary data will be retrieved is
      left up to the instrumentation.
      Attributes defined in this event denote the state of the app when the crash
      happened, not when the event was created. Therefore, what are normally obtained
      from Resource attributes like OS and service versions that are also specified in
      the event MUST be retreived from the event itself. In other words, attributes in
      the event override their equivalents in the Resource, and any related attributes
      not specified MUST be assumed to be on the Resource (e.g. if service.version is
      specified but service.name is not, it is assume it will be in the Resource).

    name: app.screen.click
    brief: >
      This event represents an instantaneous click on the screen of an application.
    note: >
      The `app.screen.click` event can be used to indicate that a user has
      clicked or tapped on the screen portion of an application. Clicks
      outside of an application's active area SHOULD NOT generate this event.
      This event does not differentiate between touch/mouse down and
      touch/mouse up. Implementations SHOULD give preference to generating
      this event at the time the click is complete, typically on touch
      release or mouse up. The location of the click event MUST be provided
      in absolute screen pixels.

      This event indicates that the application has detected substandard UI

      Jank happens when the UI is rendered slowly enough for the user to
      experience some disruption or sluggishness.
