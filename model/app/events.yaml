    type: event
    name: app.crash
    brief: >
      This event represents an unexpected termination of a user-facing application.
    note: |
      This event identifies an app crash, defined as an unexpected termination
      of a user-facing application. It can be recorded synchronously with the crashing
      of the app just prior to the termination of the application process or
      asynchronously some time after.
      It MAY contain details about the crash that can be helpful for contextualizing
      and grouping them, data captured by the instrumentation synchronously or
      retrieved via an external source like a crash capturing library. This data
      MAY be in a format that is not understable by the instrumentation, or require
      additional information in order to be used (e.g. mapping files to deobfuscate
      stacktraces). Additional information about how this data can be parsed and used
      SHOULD be available in the event, but it is NOT REQUIRED that having the data
      in the event alone will allow you to use the accompanying data (e.g. including
      deobfuscation information in the event is not feasible).
      How the instrumentation will determine whether an instance of a crash has
      already been reported and how the necessary data will be retrieved is
      left up to the instrumentation.
      Attributes defined in this event denote the state of the app when the crash
      happened, not when the event was created. Therefore, what are normally obtained
      from Resource attributes like OS and service versions that are also specified in
      the event MUST be retreived from the event itself. In other words, attributes in
      the event override their equivalents in the Resource, and any related attributes
      not specified MUST be assumed to be on the Resource (e.g. if service.version is
      specified but service.name is not, it is assume it will be in the Resource).

    brief: >
      This event represents an instantaneous click on the screen of an application.
    note: >
      The `app.screen.click` event can be used to indicate that a user has
      clicked or tapped on the screen portion of an application. Clicks
      outside of an application's active area SHOULD NOT generate this event.
      This event does not differentiate between touch/mouse down and
      touch/mouse up. Implementations SHOULD give preference to generating
      this event at the time the click is complete, typically on touch
      release or mouse up. The location of the click event MUST be provided
      in absolute screen pixels.

      This event indicates that the application has detected substandard UI
      rendering performance.

      Jank happens when the UI is rendered slowly enough for the user to
      experience some disruption or sluggishness.
