        brief: >
          A unique identifier representing an instance of an end-user facing application being unexpectedly terminated.
        note: |
          Its value SHOULD be meaningful and COULD be used as a reference for other telemetry and metadata recorded by
          the same instrumentation (e.g. it is an ID generated by an external source that captured the crash).
          It COULD come from a source external to the instrumentation such that it can be used to look up additional
          data from other sources.
        examples:
          - 083d3d2d-9a0e-47f8-be3d-bc3c5538ba38
      - id: app.crash.source

        stability: development
        brief: >
          The source from which the instrumentation obtained the data related to an unexpected termination of an end-user facing application.
        note: |
          Its value COULD represent a platform-specific API, well-known technique, an external library, or anything to pin the source of the data to enable its interpretation.
        examples: [ 'jvm', 'ios_kscrash', 'my-cool-native-crash-catcher' ]

      - id: app.installation.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          A unique identifier representing the installation of an application on a specific device
        note: |
          Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
          It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
          Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
          If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
          If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
          Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

          For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

          For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

          - [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
          - A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
          - [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
          - [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

          More information about Android identifier best practices can be found in the [Android user data IDs guide](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids).

          It typically contains multiple widgets or UI components and
