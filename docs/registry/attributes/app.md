**[1] `app.crash.data`:** Its value MUST match what is defined in 'app.crash.data.content_type'.

**[2] `app.crash.data.content_type`:** This allows 'app.crash.data' to be programmatically interpreted, though more information will be needed to understand the semantics of the underlying data.

**[3] `app.crash.id`:** Its value SHOULD be meaningful and COULD be used as a reference for other telemetry and metadata recorded by
the same instrumentation (e.g. it is an ID generated by an external source that captured the crash).
It COULD come from a source external to the instrumentation such that it can be used to look up additional
data from other sources.

**[4] `app.crash.source`:** Its value COULD represent a platform-specific API, well-known technique, an external library, or anything to pin the source of the data to enable its interpretation.

**[5] `app.crash.source.version`:** Its value COULD be used to determine how the additional data associated with this crash can be interpreted.

**[6] `app.installation.id`:** Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

- [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
- A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
- [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
- [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

More information about Android identifier best practices can be found in the [Android user data IDs guide](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids).

**[7] `app.jank.frame_count`:** Depending on platform limitations, the value provided MAY be approximation.

**[8] `app.screen.id`:** A screen represents only the part of the device display drawn by the app. It typically contains multiple widgets or UI components and is larger in scope than individual widgets. Multiple screens can coexist on the same display simultaneously (e.g., split view on tablets).

**[9] `app.screen.name`:** A screen represents only the part of the device display drawn by the app. It typically contains multiple widgets or UI components and is larger in scope than individual widgets. Multiple screens can coexist on the same display simultaneously (e.g., split view on tablets).

**[10] `app.widget.id`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

**[11] `app.widget.name`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.
